Embracing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and DRY principle, I strive for a clean, organized codebase that fosters maintainability and scalability - in the rare chance this project ever grows to something unexpected. To ensure clarity and ease of use, I've meticulously documented this project according to the OpenAPI standard with Swagger. One unique aspect of this project is its reliance on lightweight data processing, foregoing the need for a traditional database. To achieve this, I crafted a buffer to handle images so it deals with image data directly in memory, avoiding the need to write it down. This may impact latency since the images are served without the need for a retrieval move. No need for a persistent storage. This decision reflects my commitment to simplicity. You need a barcode image, you get it. You need a little bit of information for that type of barcode, you get it. ",

To run the Music Time Machine Project, you need Python installed on your computer, a Spotify account, and a Spotify app created through the Spotify Developer Dashboard. The app created in the Developer Dashboard will serve as the projectâ€™s base, providing necessary credentials like CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REDIRECT_URI. These credentials are essential for authenticating and interacting with Spotify's API, and should be securely stored as environment variables in your operating system to protect them from unauthorized access. Once the setup is complete, users can input a specific date in the format YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) to use the application. The program will then fetch and play songs that were popular on Spotify on that date, effectively creating a musical time-travel experience. The project includes detailed instructions on how to create a Spotify app and obtain the necessary credentials, as well as how to set environment variables. Screenshots of the app running are also provided for reference.
